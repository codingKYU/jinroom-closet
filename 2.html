  <p>Kitsuné Musique’s philosophy has always been singling out the up and coming talents about to break through in music, always on the lookout for promising bands and producers. The Parisian Label first started its music activity by releasing singles of promising bands and commissioning remixes for each release by no less talented producers and DJs.

In 2015, Kitsuné Musique dared to go further down the innovation and musical curation path with the launch of its on-going playlist New, Hot & Fresh, showcasing hand-picked curation of international emerging and upcoming artists.

If there is a Kitsuné Musique sound, then it’s an incredibly diverse one, led by the passion for talent-scouting. </p>
